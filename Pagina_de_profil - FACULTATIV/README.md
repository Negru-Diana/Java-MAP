# 📄 User Profile Page Project
This project presents the development of a *User Profile Page* using two Java technologies: **JavaFX** and **Java Swing**. The focus is on *Graphical User Interface* design, user data management, and event handling, aiming to create an interactive profile display with dynamic features.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
This repository is organized into two main implementations, showcasing the flexibility of Java flexibility in creating GUI interfaces:

-  📂 **Facultativ_JavaFX** – A modern, responsive UI built with JavaFX.

-  📂 **Facultativ_JavaSwing** – A classic, component-based UI developed using Java Swing.

Additionally, the project includes:

-  📜 **User Data Files** (e.g., Utilizatori_1.txt, Utilizatori_2.txt) – These files store user profile details such as names, emails, and other personal information.

-  🖼️ **Profile Pictures** (e.g., profilePicture1.JPG, profilePicture2.JPG) – Used to personalize the user interface, making the profiles visually appealing.


## 🎨 User Interface Implementations
### 1️⃣ JavaFX Implementation (📂 *Facultativ_JavaFX*)

-  Built with **JavaFX**, offering a modern, responsive, and scalable interface.

-  **Features**:

    -  **FXML-based Design**: Separates UI layout from the application logic for improved maintainability.

    -  **CSS Styling**: Customizes the appearance of the UI, making it visually appealing.

    -  **Event Handling**: Implements robust event listeners to manage user interactions seamlessly.

    -  **Flexible Layouts**: Utilizes modern JavaFX components like SceneBuilder, Pane, and VBox for dynamic UI construction.

### 2️⃣ Java Swing Implementation (📂 Facultativ_JavaSwing)

-  Developed using the **Java Swing** library, which provides a lightweight, component-based UI.

-  **Features**:

    -  **Component-based Layout**: Uses core Swing components like JPanel, JLabel, JButton, etc., for designing the interface.

    -  **Event Listeners**: Implements action listeners for buttons and interactive elements to enable dynamic user actions.

    -  **Simple & Efficient**: Focuses on providing a straightforward, functional user interface.

    -  **Circular Profile Picture Effect**: Implements a visually appealing circular mask effect for profile pictures, giving them a polished and modern look.

## 📂 User Data Management
### Data Storage & Retrieval:

-  The project loads user profile data from external text files (*Utilizatori_1.txt*, *Utilizatori_2.txt*) to dynamically populate the user interface.

-  **Profile Pictures**: The application reads image files (e.g., .JPG) to display personalized profile pictures alongside the user’s information.

### How It Works:

-  The application parses the text files to extract essential user details, such as name, email, and bio.

-  These details are displayed dynamically in the UI, allowing for real-time updates and user interactions.

-  **Event Handling**: Users can modify their information (e.g., updating their bio or email) through interactive buttons, which trigger specific ActionListeners for updates.

## 🌟 Key Features
-  **Dual GUI Implementation**: Demonstrates both *JavaFX* and *Java Swing*, showcasing the versatility of Java in building user interfaces.

-  **Dynamic Data Loading**: Loads and displays user profiles and images from external files.

-  **Profile Picture Integration**: Enhances user personalization by displaying a profile picture along with other profile details.

-  **Profile Picture as Circle (Java Swing)**: Adds a circular profile picture for a modern and stylish look using *Graphics2D* for image manipulation.

-  **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers a clean, intuitive interface, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with their profile.

-  **Event-Driven Interactions**: Implements *ActionListeners* for smooth, responsive buttons and actions.

-  **Modular & Scalable**: Follows *modular design principles*, making it easy to maintain and scale for future improvements.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights
-  💻 **Language**: Java

-  🖥️ **Technologies Used**: JavaFX, Java Swing

-  📄 **Data Storage**: Text files (.txt) for user data and image files (.JPG) for profile pictures

-  🔄 **Event Handling**: *ActionListeners* for managing user interactions and ensuring a seamless experience.

-  🎨 **UI Framework**: Modern and classic frameworks showcasing Java's capability in creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

-  🖼️ **Profile Picture Manipulation**: *Graphics2D* in Java Swing to create circular profile pictures for a polished look.
