# 📄 User Profile Page Project
This project demonstrates the development of a *User Profile Page* using two powerful Java technologies: **JavaFX** and **Java Swing**. The focus is on *Graphical User Interface* design, user data management, and event handling, aiming to create an interactive profile display with dynamic features.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
The repository is organized into two main implementations, showcasing the flexibility of Java’s GUI capabilities:

-  📂 Facultativ_JavaFX – A modern, responsive UI built with JavaFX.

-  📂 Facultativ_JavaSwing – A classic, component-based UI developed using Java Swing.

Additionally, the project includes:

-  📜 User Data Files (e.g., Utilizatori_1.txt, Utilizatori_2.txt) – These files store user profile details such as names, emails, and other personal information.

-  🖼️ Profile Pictures (e.g., profilePicture1.JPG, profilePicture2.JPG) – Used to personalize the user interface, making the profiles visually appealing.


## 🎨 User Interface Implementations
### 1️⃣ JavaFX Implementation (📂 *Facultativ_JavaFX*)

-  Built with JavaFX, offering a modern, responsive, and scalable interface.

-  Features:

    -  FXML-based Design: Separates UI layout from the application logic for improved maintainability.

    -  CSS Styling: Customizes the appearance of the UI, making it visually appealing.

    -  Event Handling: Implements robust event listeners to manage user interactions seamlessly.

    -  Flexible Layouts: Utilizes modern JavaFX components like SceneBuilder, Pane, and VBox for dynamic UI construction.

### 2️⃣ Java Swing Implementation (📂 Facultativ_JavaSwing)

-  Developed using the Java Swing library, which provides a lightweight, component-based UI.

-  Features:

    -  Component-based Layout: Uses core Swing components like JPanel, JLabel, JButton, etc., for designing the interface.

    -  Event Listeners: Implements action listeners for buttons and interactive elements to enable dynamic user actions.

    -  Simple & Efficient: Focuses on providing a straightforward, functional user interface without the complexity of modern frameworks.

    -  Circular Profile Picture Effect: Implements a visually appealing circular mask effect for profile pictures, giving them a polished and modern look.

📂 User Data Management
Data Storage & Retrieval:

The project loads user profile data from external text files (Utilizatori_1.txt, Utilizatori_2.txt) to dynamically populate the user interface.

Profile Pictures: The application reads image files (e.g., .JPG) to display personalized profile pictures alongside the user’s information.

How It Works:

The application parses the text files to extract essential user details, such as name, email, and bio.

These details are displayed dynamically in the UI, allowing for real-time updates and user interactions.

Event Handling: Users can modify their information (e.g., updating their bio or email) through interactive buttons, which trigger specific ActionListeners for updates.

🌟 Key Features
✅ Dual GUI Implementation: Demonstrates both JavaFX and Java Swing, showcasing the versatility of Java in building user interfaces.

✅ Dynamic Data Loading: Loads and displays user profiles and images from external files.

✅ Profile Picture Integration: Enhances user personalization by displaying a profile picture along with other profile details.

✅ Circular Profile Picture Effect (Java Swing): Applies a circular mask to profile pictures, providing a modern and stylish look.

✅ User-Friendly Interface: Offers a clean, intuitive interface, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with their profile.

✅ Event-Driven Interactions: Implements ActionListeners for smooth, responsive buttons and actions.

✅ Modular & Scalable: Follows modular design principles, making it easy to maintain and scale for future improvements.
