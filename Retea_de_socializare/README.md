# 📄 Social Network Application Project
This project is a *Social Network Application* developed in Java, designed to provide core social features such as friendship management, private messaging, private group creation, and real-time notifications. The application simulates a messaging platform where users can interact through friend requests, private groups and private messages, enriching the social experience.



## 🌟 Key Features
### 1️⃣ User Profiles
- **Registration & Login**: Users can create accounts, login.

- **Profile Information**: Users can view profile details.

### 2️⃣ Friend Requests & Management
-  **Send/Receive Friend Requests**: Users can send and receive friend requests to connect with others.

-  **Accept/Reject Requests**: Friend requests can be accepted or rejected by the user.

-  **View Friends**: Users can view their list of friends, including mutual friends with others.

### 3️⃣ Private Messaging
-  **Direct Messaging**: Users can send private messages to their friends.

-  **Message History**: Keeps a history of all messages exchanged.

-  **Reply to Messages**: Users can reply to specific messages, facilitating ongoing conversations.

-  **Inbox**: Displays unread and old messages for easy navigation.

### 4️⃣ Private Group Chat
-  **Create Groups**: Users can create private groups for specific social interactions.

-  **Group Messaging**: Users can send and receive messages within the group.

-  **Group Privacy**: Ensures private communication.

### 5️⃣ Notifications
-  **Real-Time Notifications**: The app sends notifications to users for new friend requests.

###  6️⃣ Database Interaction
-  **Database Connectivity**: The application interacts with a PostgreSQL database to manage user data, friend requests, messages, and groups.

-  **SQL Queries**: Efficient queries handle data retrieval and storage for users, friends, messages, etc.

-  **Pagination**: Ensures smooth data navigation.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights
-  💻 **Language**: Java ( Java 8 Features)

-  🖥️ **Technologies Used**: JavaFX (for UI), PostgreSQL (for database), JDBC (for database connectivity)

-  📄 **Database**: PostgreSQL used for storing user profiles, friend requests, messages, groups, and notifications.

-  🔄 **Event Handling**: *ActionListeners* and *MouseListeners* manage user interactions and update the interface dynamically.

-  📲 **Real-Time Notifications**: Users receive instant notifications for important activities, keeping the app interactive and engaging.

-  🛠️ **Modular Design**: The system is divided into separate classes, each responsible for specific features, making it easy to maintain and scale.



## 🎨 Design Patterns & Modern Java Features
-  🔄 **Observer/Observable Pattern**: Keeps the UI automatically updated with changes such as new friend requests, messages, and notifications, without requiring a manual refresh.

-  🔢 **Streams API & Lambda Expressions**: Simplifies collection processing, making the code cleaner and more efficient by using the Streams API for data manipulation and lambda expressions for functional-style operations.

-  ⚡ **Optional**: Manages potential null values gracefully, avoiding NullPointerExceptions and improving overall app stability.
